# Solving the sequence is not enough!
We need to know the structure and function of the protein!

### How can we predict function from structure?
In order to predict the function from the structure, scientists uses different approaches including machine learning (ML) and deep learning algorithms.]

Because of the growing gap between the newly-sequenced  and characterized sequences in the genome databases, computational methods in gene functional annotation are indispensable. Moreover, given the drop in the cost of the genome sequencing techniques, this gap is only destined to grow.]
