Because of the growing gap between the newly-sequenced  and characterized sequences in the genome databases, computational methods in gene functional annotation are indispensable. Moreover, given the drop in the cost of the genome sequencing techniques, this gap is only destined to grow.]

## In line with vision 2030, we are staring an Open Science Community in Saudi Arabia.
## It's created and developed with the help of the "Open Life Sciences"

Open Life Sciences (OLS3) program helps individuals and stakeholders in research to become Open Science ambassadors.

We want to provide a place where newcomers and experienced peers interact, inspire each other to embed open science (research) practices and values in their workflows and provide feedback on policies, infrastructures and support services. Together working to make Open Science the norm. So we are calling out to researchers and colleagues in Saudi Arabia.
